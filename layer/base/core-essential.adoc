= Essential Configuration

== What it provides

The essential layer doesn't define variables itself but ensures that every build has access to:

. **Artefact naming**
. **Build environment**
. **Target configuration**
. **Core build infrastructure**

== Architecture Role

* **Foundation layer**: Sits at the bottom of the dependency hierarchy
* **Mandatory inclusion**: Cannot be excluded from any build
* **Infrastructure aggregation**: Pulls together all essential base layers
* **Dependency management**: Ensures consistent base infrastructure across builds

== Benefits

* **Guaranteed infrastructure**: Every build has the required foundation
* **Consistent behaviour**: Same core variables available in every build
* **Future-proof**: Easy to add more essential dependencies as needed

== Usage

Users don't need to explicitly include this layer - it's automatically included by the build system. All other layers can depend on essential to ensure they have access to the core build infrastructure. This ensures that every rpi-image-gen build, whether filesystem-only or full image, has access to the fundamental build tools and configuration needed for successful execution.
