# X-Env-Var-apt_proxy:
# X-Env-Var-apt_proxy-Desc: APT Proxy URL
# If you require the use of an APT HTTP proxy, set it using this. The proxy
# setting will not be included in the image, making it safe to use an
# `apt-cacher` or similar package for development.

# X-Env-Var-apt_get_purge: y
# X-Env-Var-apt_get_purge-Desc: Purge APT operations in the chroot by default.
# Refer to apt-get(8).

# X-Env-Var-apt_get_purge-Valid: bool
# X-Env-Var-apt_get_purge-Set: y
#
# X-Env-Var-apt_keydir:
# X-Env-Var-apt_keydir-Desc: APT key directory
# If a particular collection of keys are required for bdebstrap to download
# packages from the mirror(s) provided, set the directory containing them here.
# This will be passed to bdebstrap via aptopt Dir::Etc::TrustedParts. If not
# specified, rpi-image-gen sets this directory and assembles the keys it
# requires into it.
# This particular setting of Dir::Etc::TrustedParts will not be included in the
# image. If using this option, please make sure to install your key(s) into the
# chroot explicitly if a key contained in this directory points to a location
# that is not otherwise populated during chroot creation (for example by
# installing a keyring package).
# X-Env-Var-apt_keydir-Required: n

# X-Env-Var-apt_keydir-Set: y

# X-Env-Var-apt_cachedir:
# X-Env-Var-apt_cachedir-Desc: Cache directory for APT operations.
# Use this to specify the root directory APT uses when downloading packages.
# APT will re-use packages found this directory where possible, meaning that
# usage of this directory can decrease rebuild time.
# The directory will be passed to bdebstrap via aptopt Dir::Cache. Sub-
# directory archives will be created if it doesn't exist and passed as
# Dir::Cache::archives.
# Neither directory will be cleaned up upon build completion.
# By default, the cache dir resides in the chroot and is cleaned up
# automatically upon build completion.

# X-Env-Var-workroot: $(realpath --canonicalize-missing ./work)

# being built, this directory can amount to a substantial amount of consumed
# disk space.
